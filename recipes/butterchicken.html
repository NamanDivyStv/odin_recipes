      Butter Chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a rich and flavorful
      Indian dish made with tender pieces of chicken simmered in a creamy
      tomato-based sauce. The chicken is typically marinated in yogurt and
      spices, then grilled or cooked until slightly charred before being added
      to the sauce, which is infused with butter, cream, and aromatic spices
      like garam masala, cumin, and coriander. Known for its smooth texture and
      mildly spiced, slightly sweet flavor, butter chicken is often served with
      naan or basmati rice, making it a beloved comfort food both in India and
      around the world.
