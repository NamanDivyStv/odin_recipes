        Chili Paneer is a popular Indo-Chinese dish made with crispy cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) tossed in a spicy, tangy sauce. The dish is characterized by its bold, savory flavors and a combination of heat from green chilies, sweetness from soy sauce, and a hint of vinegar. The paneer is typically deep-fried until golden and then stir-fried with a mix of bell peppers, onions, and aromatic spices like ginger, garlic, and soy sauce. It's usually garnished with fresh coriander and served as a starter or appetizer, often paired with steamed rice or noodles. The crunchy texture of the paneer combined with the rich, zesty sauce makes Chili Paneer a favorite in Indian and Chinese fusion cuisine.
