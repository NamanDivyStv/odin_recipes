## ðŸ“– Introduction

This project is a basic **Recipe Website** built using only HTML. It serves as a digital cookbook where users can view a collection of recipes, each with its own dedicated page containing ingredients, preparation steps, and images.

The goal of this project is to create a clean and organized structure for a multi-page website using pure HTML. 

By completing this project, I will demonstrate skills in:

- Structuring web pages using semantic HTML
- Organizing content into reusable and navigable pages
- Creating a consistent layout across multiple HTML files
- Building the foundation for future enhancements with CSS, JavaScript, or backend technologies

This project lays the groundwork for a fully functional recipe web app and showcases my understanding of web development fundamentals.
